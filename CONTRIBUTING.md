# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in contributing to **Create Holes Around Polygon**.

This project aims to provide a small, stable, and predictable FreeCAD macro that
solves a specific geometry problem well. Contributions are welcome, but should
respect the project’s focus and constraints.

---

## Project goals

- Provide reliable, perimeter-aware hole placement
- Avoid fragile Sketcher or LinearPattern dependencies
- Remain idempotent (safe to re-run)
- Prefer clarity and robustness over feature breadth

The goal is not to become a full workbench or automation framework.

## How to contribute

### Reporting issues
- Please check existing issues before opening a new one
- Clearly describe:
  - FreeCAD version
  - Sketch type (lines, arcs, mixed)
  - Expected vs actual behavior
- Screenshots are helpful, but optional

---

### Proposing features
- Open an issue before starting work
- Keep proposals scoped and focused
- Features should align with an existing milestone when possible

If you’re unsure whether a feature fits, open an issue to discuss it first.
